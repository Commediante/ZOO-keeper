# ZOO-keeper

?
Simple tutorial project that teaches you how to use loops and template literals.
You can try it on hyperskill.org, JetBrains Academy, Frontend Developer Track.

!
This project isn't perfect though. It has some mistakes and tasks are poorly worded.
There's an option to finish it on hyperskill.org site or on your WebStorm,
however I couldn't synchronize it with my WS for some reason. It is doable online though.

.
I don't think there's any potential to expand it for now.
There are other, more challenging and promising projects on this course.
You can check out my Virtual Piano project from hyperskill.org:
